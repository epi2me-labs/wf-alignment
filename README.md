# Alignment workflow

Align nanopore sequencing data and visualize mapping statistics.



## Introduction

This workflow provides an easy way to align Oxford Nanopore reads and gather mapping
stats either locally for small amounts of data or at scale in a distributed
environment such as a cluster or the cloud.

> This workflow contains minimal functionality that is duplicated in many of our more specialised workflows.
> Please consider using one of these alternative workflows before using this one: you very likely do not need
> to use this workflow.

In brief, it will perform the following:
* Combine all reference files in the directory passed to `--references`.
* Align input reads (passed as FASTQ or unaligned BAM files) against the reference (Note that BAM files with aligned reads can be used as well; these will skip the alignment step and only stats and the report will be produced).
* Create alignment stats.
* Calculate depth of coverage along the reference sequences (this step can be skipped if requested).
* Create an HTML report to illustrate the results.




## Compute requirements

Recommended requirements:

+ CPUs = 12
+ Memory = 32GB

Minimum requirements:

+ CPUs = 6
+ Memory = 12GB

Approximate run time: 0.5-5 minutes per sample (depending on number of reads, length of reference, and available compute).

ARM processor support: True




## Install and run


These are instructions to install and run the workflow on command line.
You can also access the workflow via the
[EPI2ME Desktop application](https://labs.epi2me.io/downloads/).

The workflow uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage
compute and software resources,
therefore Nextflow will need to be
installed before attempting to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
or [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html)
to provide isolation of the required software.
Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either Docker or Singularity is installed.
This is controlled by the
[`-profile`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-profiles)
parameter as exemplified below.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository
in order to run the workflow.
More information on running EPI2ME workflows can
be found on our [website](https://labs.epi2me.io/wfindex).

The following command can be used to obtain the workflow.
This will pull the repository in to the assets folder of
Nextflow and provide a list of all parameters
available for the workflow as well as an example command:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-alignment --help
```
To update a workflow to the latest version on the command line use
the following command:
```
nextflow pull epi2me-labs/wf-alignment
```

A demo dataset is provided for testing of the workflow.
It can be downloaded and unpacked using the following commands:
```
wget https://ont-exd-int-s3-euwst1-epi2me-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/wf-alignment/wf-alignment-demo.tar.gz
tar -xzvf wf-alignment-demo.tar.gz
```
The workflow can then be run with the downloaded demo data using:
```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-alignment \
	--fastq 'wf-alignment-demo/fastq' \
	--references 'wf-alignment-demo/references' \
	-profile standard
```

For further information about running a workflow on
the command line see https://labs.epi2me.io/wfquickstart/

## Input example

<!---Example of input directory structure, delete and edit as appropriate per workflow.--->
This workflow accepts either FASTQ or BAM files as input.

The FASTQ or BAM input parameters for this workflow accept one of three cases: (i) the path to a single FASTQ or BAM file; (ii) the path to a top-level directory containing FASTQ or BAM files; (iii) the path to a directory containing one level of sub-directories which in turn contain FASTQ or BAM files. In the first and second cases (i and ii), a sample name can be supplied with `--sample`. In the last case (iii), the data is assumed to be multiplexed with the names of the sub-directories as barcodes. In this case, a sample sheet can be provided with `--sample_sheet`.

```
(i)                     (ii)                 (iii)

| reference_mmi_file | string | Path to an MMI index file to be used as reference. | Accepted file extension is '.mmi'. The references parameter is still required if this is provided. Note that some minimap2 alignment options are set by the reference MMI and cannot be overridden. |  |
| counts | string | Path to a CSV file containing expected counts as a control. | The expected counts CSV file must contain columns named 'reference' and 'expected_counts' in order to be valid. the 'reference' column should contain names matching the names of reference sequences within the fasta files provided using --references. |  |


### Sample Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| sample_sheet | string | A CSV file used to map barcodes to sample aliases. The sample sheet can be provided when the input data is a directory containing sub-directories with FASTQ files. | The sample sheet is a CSV file with, minimally, columns named `barcode` and `alias`. Extra columns are allowed. A `type` column is required for certain workflows and should have the following values; `test_sample`, `positive_control`, `negative_control`, `no_template_control`. |  |

## Pipeline overview

### 1. Combine reference files

All reference files in the directory passed to `--references` are concatenated.

### 2. Align reads

Input reads are aligned against the combined reference with [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2). If BAM files are used as input (with `--bam`), only reads in files without a reference in the SAM header are aligned. For other BAM files this step is skipped.

### 3. Create alignment stats

[Bamstats](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/fastcat#bamstats) is used to create per-read and per-reference alignment stats from the BAM files.

### 4. Calculate depth of coverage

Depth of coverage along the reference sequences is determined with [Mosdepth](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth) (using 200 windows per reference sequence). To speed up the workflow, this step can be skipped by adding `--depth-coverage false`.




## Troubleshooting

+ If the workflow fails please run it with the demo data set to ensure the workflow itself is working. This will help us determine if the issue is related to the environment, input parameters or a bug.
+ Please see [here](https://labs.epi2me.io/trouble-shooting/) for how to resolve some common Nextflow issues and [here](https://labs.epi2me.io/how-to-exits/) for how to interpret command exit codes.




## FAQ's

*I cannot select a single reference file in the EPI2ME desktop app.* - When running the workflow via the desktop app, you need to provide a directory with reference files. If you only have a single file, you can create a directory to place your reference file inside and select this with the reference input option.

*How are the values in the `acc` column (and other metrics) in the per-read output stats calculated?* -
For details on the per-read stats output files, please refer to the [fastcat/bamstats documentation](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/fastcat#output-format).
